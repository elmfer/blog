Soon we are going to learn React, but before we do, we need to learn webpack. From what I understood, webpack is used for packaging web apps with a large payload into a minified compact package. Frameworks like React uses webpack under the hood, and its underlying funtions are convuluted enough to where it is beneficial to learn it to have a better understanding on how to use the framework effectively.

To start, I went to the webpack website, and I found an article on *Getting Started* with webpack. So I created an empty node project with `npm init` and installed `webpack` and `webpack-cli`. The article comes with a sample project with `html` and `js` files for a basic website, but I am going to clone a small website that I made a while ago: [Coding Quizzer](https://github.com/elmfer/coding-quizzer).
