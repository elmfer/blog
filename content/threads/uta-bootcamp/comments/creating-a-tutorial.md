At this date, I have to work on an assignment that involves writing a tutorial on how to use regexes. I'd say this good to do since one of my goals as a developer is to be able to teach other developers to do the similar things I am doing without them having to spend time reasearching a topic completely from scratch.

What I gotta do is to get familar with regexes since I had only scratched the surface on it briefly at one point.

Firstly, I am gonna copy the template they provided over to a new gist on my GitHub account.
