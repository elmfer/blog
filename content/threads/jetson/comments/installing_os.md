I purchaced a 64GB Sandisk microSD card on walkmart for it to be used as the main drive for the Jetson computer. Jetson includes instructions on how to write the OS image onto the SD card. You bassically download the OS image off of NVIDIA's Jetson site and then use blencaEtcher to write the image to the SD card.

Plugging in the card to the Jetson and plugging it with a 5v 2A power supply aswell as the the HDMI cable to show video onto the TV prompts it to boot up with no struggle.
