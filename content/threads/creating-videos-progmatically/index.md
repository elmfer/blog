I have a love-hate relationship with creating videos. I like how it allows me to share my work in a dynamic format that could convey quality information to others, yet I find it very tedious to make them because video editing is repetitive and time consuming. I do admit, I am lazy at video editing.

So I thought, what if I make my video programtically? After creating a few videos, I noticed that I have a consistent style, and I thought there could be an easy way to automate it. After all, I'd rather be programming than editing, so I think is a good solution for me.

I do have some goals in mind for my future application to meet.

* Be able to import images and videos directly from the internet. (No need to have to download and save every single piece of media)
* Be able to create a videos easily from an outline (from a script).
* Be able to customize its behavior by writing scripts.

So, how do I go about achieving this?
